# RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢

> RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢ is Artificial Inteligence [IoT] framework for all purposes. Is written in [Python] and uses [Alicebot AIML 2.0]. RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢ needs no screens. Just type or say commands like to normal people in front of you. RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢ do command, tells you something or does another action depending on his installed modules for sensors and devices. Developers can write own modules and enhance RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢. Possibilities are endless. From home assistant (primary use), car assistants, airplanes assistants, interactive robots and true `Smart Watches` to clever space ships like in Star Trek in future :)

## There is Amazon Echo and Google Home. Where are differencies compare to them?
> So. It's simple. Amazon Echo and Google Home are closed systems with own harware and software policies. RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢ is framework. You can build own UNIX like device with own sensors and parts (for example speaker and microphone) and use RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢'s code. You can sale this devices as your product if you want. You can create own modules for devices compatibility and share this modules, do edits in RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢'s code or create own forks and versions. All without policies and bureaucracy.

## Features
  - Open Source
  - Based on [Alicebot AIML 2.0]
  - RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢ understands your sentences and reacts (Just tell him "Prepare some coffee for me", or "How many people live on Earth"...)
  - Text to speech
  - Runs on all [UNIX] devices include [MacOS]
  - Primary used for [Intel Edison], but can run on another devices - small or big ones
  - Prepared for [IoT] manufacturers (just connect your sensors and devices using RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢'s methods)

## To-do
- Support for [Answers.com], [Wolfram Alpha], [Wikipedia] and other services
- Using of another bots in network (Your home instance of RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢ can ask for closing of doors in your company for example. There can be closing IoT device for door or just another RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢ based server managing this IoT device himself.)
- Voice recognization
- Support for sensors and devices using [Intel Edison]
- Support for sensors and devices using protocols
- Web Admin based on Python's Flask with configurable IP address (public IP can be set), login screen, graphs, console and online modules + wysiwig AIML editor. You can manage and program RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢ using web admin
- Libraries for main programming languages (One can communicate with RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢ using mobile phone microphone and text input for example. RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢ can show informations on display and use mobile phone speaker.)
- [Python] GUI for desktop platforms based on libraries with nice design
- User profiles with users swithching ("Hello, here is Thomas. Can you do some notes for me?", "Hi Thomas, what do you want to note?")
- Support for localization and for multiple voice rocognization and text to speech libraries

## Installation

### Linux
- Install [Python 3] first
and then:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
$ pip3 install pyaml
$ pip3 install python-dateutil
$ pip3 install requests
$ pip3 install pydub
$ pip3 install wikipedia
$ pip3 install flask
$ apt-get install libav-tools libavcodec-extra-53
or
$ apt-get install ffmpeg libavcodec-extra-53
```

### MacOS
- Install [Python 3] first
and then:

```sh
$ pip3 install pyaml
$ pip3 install python-dateutil
$ pip3 install requests
$ pip3 install pydub
$ pip3 install wikipedia
$ pip3 install flask
$ xcode-select --install
$ brew install libav --with-libvorbis --with-sdl --with-theora
or
$ brew install ffmpeg --with-libvorbis --with-ffplay --with-theora
```

## Lauching
- CD to RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢ folder in terminal 
and then:

```sh
$ sh start.sh
```

> You can set automatic lauching of this script on restart as well.

## Stopping
- Hit CTRL+C in terminal

> Do not close RüëÅbbie‚Ñ¢. He can not respond on you and can not learn when is closed. Let him live on old PC or own [Intel Edison] board for example.
